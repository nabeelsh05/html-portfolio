<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I build things where logic meets wonder.</p>

<p>I’m a creator who drifts between code and canvas, systems and stories. Some days I’m shaping websites, other days I’m sketching worlds, designing interfaces, or chasing that quiet moment when an idea finally clicks into place. I like work that feels alive - things you can poke, play with, and slowly understand.</p>

<p>This portfolio is a collection of experiments, lessons, and small obsessions. Not everything here is perfect, but everything is honest. I’m learning in public, growing through iteration, and always reaching for work that feels meaningful rather than merely finished.</p>

<p>If you’re here to explore, linger, or collaborate -- welcome.</p>
